# assignment-two
BPROG stack based interpreter, discussed and collaborated with Marius and Sander Fuhr

# Implemented features
As it stands now, features are implemented to minimal subset(D), minus some list operations. Fully functioning nested lists

# Program features
The program runs in REPL mode, and inputs are whitespace separated

# Running
To run the program, cd to the root
```shell
stack run
```

# REPL mode
Input literals and do calculations

# Did not implement tests because of time constraints
